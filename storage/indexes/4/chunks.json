{"chunks": ["1\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (META)\nSecond Quarter 2025 Results Conference Call\nJuly 30th, 2025\nKenneth Dorell, Director, Investor Relations\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta’s second quarter 2025 earnings conference call.\nJoining me today are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and Susan Li, CFO.\nOur remarks today will include forward‐looking statements, which are based on assumptions as of\ntoday. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors including those set forth in\ntoday’s earnings press release, and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. We\nundertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nDuring this call we will present both GAAP and certain non‐GAAP financial measures. A\nreconciliation of GAAP to non‐GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release. The\nearnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at\ninvestor.atmeta.com.\nAnd now, I’d like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO\nThanks Ken -- thanks everyone for joining today.\nWe had another strong quarter with more than 3.4 billion people using at least one of our apps\neach day -- and strong engagement ac", "ross the board. Our business continues to perform very\nwell, which enables us to invest heavily in our AI efforts.\nOver the last few months we have begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves.\nThe improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence -- which we define\nas AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way -- we think is now in sight.\nMeta's vision is to bring personal superintelligence to everyone -- so that people can direct it\ntowards what they value in their own lives. We believe this has the potential to begin an exciting\nnew era of individual empowerment.\nA lot has been written about the economic and scientific advances that superintelligence can\nbring. I am extremely optimistic about this. But I think that if history is a guide, then an even more\nimportant role will be how superintelligence empowers people to be more creative, develop\nculture and communities, connect with each other, and lead more fulfilling lives.\nTo build this future, we've established Meta Superintelligence Labs, which includes our\nfoundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab that is focused on developing the next\ngeneration of our models. ", "We're making good progress towards Llama 4.1 and 4.2 -- and in\nparallel, we're also working on our next generation of models that will push the frontier in the next\nyear or so.\nWe're building an elite, talent-dense team. Alexandr Wang is leading the overall team, Nat\nFriedman is leading our AI products and applied research, and Shengjia Zhao is Chief Scientist for2\nthe new effort. They're all incredibly talented leaders and I'm excited to work closely with them\nand the world-class group of AI researchers, and infrastructure and data engineers that we're\nassembling.\nI've spent a lot of time building this team this quarter, and the reason that so many people are\nexcited to join is because Meta has all the ingredients required to build leading models and deliver\nthem to billions of people. The people who are joining us will have access to unparalleled compute\nas we build out several multi-GW clusters. Our Prometheus cluster is coming online next year and\nwe think it'll be the world's first 1GW+ cluster. We're also building out Hyperion, which will be able\nto scale up to 5GW over several years. And we have multiple more titan clusters in development as\nwell.\nWe're making all these inve", "stments because we have conviction that superintelligence is going to\nimprove every aspect of what we do.\nFrom a business perspective, I mentioned last quarter that there are five basic opportunities that\nwe're pursuing: improved advertising, more engaging experiences, business messaging, Meta AI,\nand AI devices. So I can go into a bit of detail on each.\nOn advertising, the strong performance this quarter is largely thanks to AI unlocking greater\nefficiency and gains across our ads system. This quarter, we expanded our new AI-powered\nrecommendation model for ads to new surfaces and improved its performance by using more\nsignals and a longer context. It's driven roughly 5% more ad conversions on Instagram and 3% on\nFacebook.\nWe're also seeing good progress with AI for ad creative -- with a meaningful percent of our ad\nrevenue now coming from campaigns using one of our Generative AI features. This is going to be\nespecially valuable for smaller advertisers with limited budgets, while agencies will continue the\nimportant work to help larger brands apply these tools strategically.\nThe second opportunity is more engaging experiences. AI is significantly improving our ability to\nshow peop", "le content that they’re going to find interesting and useful. Advancements in our\nrecommendation systems have improved quality so much that it has led to a 5% increase in time\nspent on Facebook and 6% on Instagram just this quarter.\nThere's a lot of potential for content itself to get better too. We're seeing early progress with the\nlaunch of our AI video editing tools across Meta AI and our new Edits app, and there's a lot more to\ndo here.\nThe third opportunity is business messaging. I've talked before about how I believe every business\nwill soon have a business AI just like they have an email address, social media account, and\nwebsite. We're starting to see some product market fit in a number of countries where we're\ntesting these agents, and we're integrating these business AIs into ads on Facebook and\nInstagram, as well as directly into e-commerce websites.\nThe fourth opportunity is Meta AI. Its reach is already quite impressive with more than a billion\nmonthly actives. Our focus is now deepening the experience and making Meta AI the leading\npersonal AI. As we continue improving our models we see engagement grow, so our next\ngeneration of models is going to continue to really h", "elp here.3\nThe fifth opportunity is AI devices. We continue to see strong momentum with our Ray-Ban Meta\nglasses, with sales accelerating. We're also launching new performance AI glasses with the Oakley\nMeta HSTNs. They have longer battery life, higher resolution camera, and are designed for sports.\nThe percent of people using Meta AI is growing and we're seeing new users' AI retention increase\ntoo, which is a good sign for that continued use. I think that AI glasses are going to be the main\nway that we integrate superintelligence into our day-to-day lives, so it's important to have all\nthese different styles that appeal to different people in different settings.\nFinally, we’re seeing people continue to spend more time with our Quest ecosystem and the\ncommunity continues to grow steadily. We launched the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition last month,\nand we're seeing record interest in cloud gaming. And beyond gaming, we continue to see a\nbroader set of use cases with media and web-browsing contributing a significant portion of\nengagement.\nWe’re going to have more to share on all of this, especially our Reality Labs work, at Connect on\nSeptember 17th, so I encourage you to tune into that.\n", "Overall, this has been a busy quarter. Strong business performance and real momentum in\nassembling both the talent and the compute needed to build personal superintelligence for\neveryone. I am very grateful for our teams who are working hard to deliver this, and thanks to all of\nyou for being on this journey with us. And now, here's Susan.\nSusan Li, CFO\nThanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.\nLet’s begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless\notherwise noted.\nQ2 total revenue was $47.5 billion, up 22% on both a reported and constant currency basis.\nQ2 total expenses were $27.1 billion, up 12% compared to last year.\nIn terms of the specific line items:\nCost of revenue increased 16%, driven mostly by higher infrastructure costs and payments to\npartners, partially offset by a benefit from the previously announced extension of server useful\nlives.\nR&D increased 23%, mostly due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs.\nMarketing & Sales increased 9%, primarily due to an increase in professional services related to\nour ongoing platform integrity efforts as well as marketing costs, partially offset by lower\nemployee compensatio", "n.\nG&A decreased 27%, driven mostly by lower legal-related costs.\nWe ended Q2 with over 75,900 employees, down 1% quarter-over-quarter as the vast majority of\nthe employees impacted by performance-related reductions earlier this year were no longer4\ncaptured in our headcount. This was partially offset by continued hiring in priority areas of\nmonetization, infrastructure, Reality Labs, AI, as well as regulation and compliance.\nSecond quarter operating income was $20.4 billion, representing a 43% operating margin.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 11%, which reflects excess tax benefits from share based\ncompensation due to the increase in our share price versus prior periods.\nNet income was $18.3 billion or $7.14 per share.\nCapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $17.0 billion, driven by\ninvestments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.\nFree cash flow was $8.5 billion. We repurchased $9.8 billion of our Class A common stock and paid\n$1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders. We also made $15.1 billion in non-marketable equity\ninvestments in the second quarter, which includes our minority investment in Scale AI along with\nother investme", "nt activities. We ended the quarter with $47.1 billion in cash and marketable\nsecurities and $28.8 billion in debt.\nMoving now to our segment results.\nI’ll begin with our Family of Apps segment.\nOur community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4\nbillion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in June.\nQ2 Total Family of Apps revenue was $47.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year.\nQ2 Family of Apps ad revenue was $46.6 billion, up 21% or 22% on a constant currency basis.\nWithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year\ngrowth.\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and Rest of World at 24%\nand 23%, respectively. North America and Asia-Pacific grew 21% and 18%.\nIn Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 11%, with growth\nmainly driven by Asia-Pacific. Impression growth accelerated across all regions due primarily to\nengagement tailwinds on both Facebook and Instagram and, to a lesser extent, ad load\noptimizations on Facebook. The average price per ad increased 9%, benefiting from increased\nadvertiser demand, largely driv", "en by improved ad performance. Pricing growth slowed modestly\nfrom the first quarter due to the accelerated impression growth in Q2.\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $583 million, up 50%, driven by WhatsApp paid messaging\nrevenue growth as well as Meta Verified subscriptions.\nWe continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of\nour Family of Apps. In Q2, Family of Apps expenses were $22.2 billion, representing 82% of our\noverall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 14%, mainly due to growth in employee\ncompensation and infrastructure costs, partially offset by lower legal-related costs.5\nFamily of Apps operating income was $25.0 billion, representing a 53% operating margin.\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q2 revenue was $370 million, up 5% year-over-year due to\nincreased sales of AI glasses, partially offset by lower Quest sales.\nReality Labs expenses were $4.9 billion, up 1% year-over-year driven by higher non-headcount\nrelated technology development costs.\nReality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion.\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue\nperformance: our ability to deliver engaging", " experiences for our community, and our effectiveness\nat monetizing that engagement over time.\nOn the first, daily actives continue to grow across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp as we\nmake additional improvements to our recommendation systems and product experiences.\nWe continue to see momentum with video engagement in particular. In Q2, Instagram video time\nwas up more than 20% year-over-year globally. We’re seeing strong traction on Facebook as well,\nparticularly in the US where video time spent similarly expanded more than 20% year-over-year.\nThese gains have been enabled by ongoing optimizations to our ranking systems to better identify\nthe most relevant content to show.\nWe expect to deliver additional improvements throughout the year as we further scale up our\nmodels and make recommendations more adaptive to a person’s interests within their session.\nAnother emphasis of our recommendations work is promoting original content. On Instagram,\nover two-thirds of recommended content in the US now comes from original posts. In the second\nhalf, we’ll be focused on further increasing the freshness of original posts so the right audiences\ncan discover original content from creators so", "on after it is posted.\nWe are also making good progress on our longer-term ranking innovations that we expect will\nprovide the next leg of improvements over the coming years. Our research efforts to develop\ncross-surface foundation recommendation models continue to progress. We are also seeing\npromising results from using LLMs in Threads recommendation systems. The incorporation of\nLLMs are now driving a meaningful share of the ranking-related time spent gains on Threads.\nWe’re now exploring how to extend the use of LLMs in recommendation systems to our other\napps. We’re leveraging Llama in several other back-end processes as well, including actioning bug\nreports so we can identify and resolve recurring issues more quickly and efficiently. This has\nresulted in top-line bug reports in the US & Canada in Facebook Feed and Notifications dropping\nby roughly 30% over the past 10 months.\nThe primary way we’re using Llama in our apps today is to power Meta AI, which is now available\nin over 200 countries and territories. WhatsApp continues to be the largest driver of queries as\npeople message Meta AI directly for tasks such as information gathering, homework assistance,\nand generating ima", "ges. Outside of WhatsApp, we’re seeing Meta AI become an increasingly\nvaluable complement to our content discovery engines. Meta AI usage on Facebook is expanding\nas people use it to ask about posts they see in Feed and find content across our platform in\nSearch. Another way we expect Meta AI will help with content discovery is through the automatic6\ntranslation and dubbing of foreign-language content into the audience’s local language. We'll have\nmore to share on our efforts there later this year.\nMoving to Reality Labs. The growth of Ray-Ban Meta sales accelerated in Q2, with demand still\noutstripping supply for the most popular SKUs despite increases to our production earlier this\nyear. We’re working to ramp supply to better meet consumer demand later this year.\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance: increasing monetization efficiency.\nThe first part of this work is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement.\nWe continue to optimize ad supply across each surface to better deliver ads at the time and place\nthey are most relevant to people. In Q2, we also began introducing ads within Feed on Threads\nand the Updates tab on WhatsApp, which is a separate spac", "e away from people’s chats.\nAs of May, advertisers globally can now run video and image ads to Threads users in most\ncountries, including the United States. While ad supply remains low and Threads is not expected to\nbe a meaningful contributor to overall impression growth in the near-term, we are optimistic\nabout the longer-term opportunity with Threads as the community and engagement grow and\nmonetization scales.\nOn WhatsApp, we are rolling out ads in Status and Channels, along with Channel Subscriptions in\nthe Updates tab to help businesses reach the more than 1.5 billion daily actives who visit that part\nof the app. We expect the introduction of ads in Status will be gradual over the course of this year\nand next, with low levels of expected ad supply initially. We also expect WhatsApp ads in Status to\nearn a lower average price than Facebook or Instagram ads for the foreseeable future, due in part\nto WhatsApp’s skew toward lower monetizing markets and more limited information that can be\nused for targeting. Given this, we do not expect ads in Status to be a meaningful contributor to\ntotal impressions or revenue growth for the next few years.\nThe second part of increasing monetiz", "ation efficiency is improving marketing performance. There\nare three areas of this work that I’ll focus on today: improving our ads systems, advancing our ads\nproducts, including by building tools that assist in ads creation, and evolving our ads platform to\ndrive results that are optimized for each business’ objectives.\nFirst is our ads systems, where we’re innovating in both the ads retrieval and ranking stages to\nserve more relevant ads to people. A lot of this work involves us continuing to advance the\nmodeling innovations we’ve introduced previously while expanding their adoption across our\nplatform.\nThe Andromeda model architecture we began introducing in the second half of 2024 powers the\nads retrieval stage of our ads system, where we select the few thousand most relevant ads from\ntens of millions of potential candidates. In Q2, we made enhancements to Andromeda that\nenabled it to select more relevant and more personalized ads candidates, while also expanding\ncoverage to Facebook Reels. These improvements have driven nearly 4% higher conversions on\nFacebook mobile Feed and Reels.\nOur new Generative Ads Recommendation System, or GEM, powers the ranking stage of our ads\nsyste", "m, which is the part of the process after ads retrieval where we determine which ads to show\nsomeone from candidates suggested by our retrieval engine. In Q2, we improved the performance7\nof GEM by further scaling our training capacity and adding organic and ads engagement data on\nInstagram. We also incorporated new advanced sequence modeling techniques that helped us\ndouble the length of event sequences we use, enabling our systems to consider a longer history of\nthe content or ads that a person has engaged with in order to provide better ad selections. The\ncombination of these improvements increased ad conversions by approximately 5% on Instagram\nand 3% on Facebook Feed and Reels in Q2.\nFinally, we expanded coverage of our Lattice model architecture in Q2. We first began deploying\nLattice in 2023 with our later stage ads ranking efforts, allowing us to run significantly larger\nmodels that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous, smaller ads\nmodels that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. In April, we\nbegan deploying Lattice to earlier stage ads ranking models as well. This is leading not only to\ngreater capacit", "y and engineering efficiency, but also improved performance, with the recent\nLattice deployments driving a nearly 4% increase in ad conversions across Facebook Feed and\nReels in Q2.\nNext, ads products. Here, we’re seeing strong momentum with our Advantage+ suite of AI\npowered solutions.\nIn Q2, we completed the roll out of our streamlined campaign creation flow for Advantage+ sales\nand app campaigns, which makes it easier for advertisers to realize the performance benefits from\nAdvantage+ by having it turned on at the beginning. We’ve seen lifts in advertiser adoption of\nSales and App campaigns since we’ve expanded availability and are working to complete the\nrollout for leads campaigns in the coming months.\nWithin our Advantage+ creative suite, adoption of gen AI ad creative tools continues to broaden.\nNearly 2 million advertisers are now using our video generation features - Image Animation and\nVideo Expansion, and we’re seeing strong results with our text generation tools as we continue to\nadd new features. In Q2, we started testing AI-powered translations so that advertisers can\nautomatically translate the caption of their ads to 10 different languages. While it’s early, we’ve\ns", "een promising performance lifts in our pre-launch tests.\nWe are also continuing to see strong adoption of Image Expansion among small and medium-sized\nadvertisers, which speaks to how these tools help businesses who have fewer resources to\ndevelop creative. With larger advertisers, we expect agencies will continue to be valuable partners\nin helping apply these new tools to drive performance.\nOutside of Advantage+, we’re seeing good momentum in business messaging, particularly in the\nUS where click-to-message revenue grew more than 40% year-over-year in Q2. The strong US\ngrowth is benefiting from a ramp in adoption of our Website to Message ads, which drive people\nto a businesses’ website for more information before choosing to launch a chat with the business\nin one of our messaging apps.\nFinally, we continue to evolve our ads platform to drive results that are optimized for each\nbusiness’ objectives and the way they measure results.\nIn Q2, we completed the global roll out of our incremental attribution feature, which is the only\nproduct on the market that optimizes for and reports on incremental conversions, which are\nconversions that would not have happened without a person seeing", " the ad.8\nWe also launched Omnichannel ads globally in Q2, which enable advertisers to optimize for\nincremental sales both in-store and online with just one campaign. In tests, Advertisers using\nOmnichannel ads have seen a median 15% reduction in total Cost Per Purchase compared to\nwebsite-only optimization.\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. Our primary focus remains\ninvesting capital back into the business, with infrastructure and talent being our top priorities.\nI’ll start with hiring. Our approach to adding headcount continues to be targeted at the company’s\nhighest priority areas. We expect talent additions across all of our priority areas will continue to\ndrive overall headcount growth through this year and 2026, while headcount growth in our other\nfunctions remains constrained. Within AI, we’ve had a particular emphasis on recruiting leading\ntalent within the industry as we build out Meta Superintelligence Labs to accelerate our AI model\ndevelopment and product initiatives.\nNext, infrastructure. We expect having sufficient compute capacity will be central to realizing\nmany of the largest opportunities in front of us over the coming years. We co", "ntinue to see very\ncompelling returns from our AI capacity investments in our core ads and organic engagement\ninitiatives, and expect to continue investing significantly there in 2026. We also expect that\ndeveloping leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and\nproduct experiences, so we expect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that\nwork.\nMoving to our financial outlook. We expect third quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of\n$47.5-50.5 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is an approximately 1% tailwind to\nyear-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. While we are not providing\nan outlook for fourth quarter revenue, we would expect our year-over-year growth rate in the\nfourth quarter of 2025 to be slower than the third quarter as we lap a period of stronger growth in\nthe fourth quarter of 2024.\nTurning now to the expense outlook.\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-118 billion, narrowed from our\nprior outlook of $113-118 billion and reflecting a growth rate of 20-24% year-over-year.\nWhile we’re still very early in planning for next year, there ", "are a few factors we expect will provide\nmeaningful upward pressure on our 2026 total expense growth rate. The largest single driver of\ngrowth will be infrastructure costs, driven by a sharp acceleration in depreciation expense growth\nand higher operating costs as we continue to scale up our infrastructure fleet. Aside from\ninfrastructure, we expect the second largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as we\nadd technical talent in priority areas and recognize a full year of compensation expenses for\nemployees hired throughout 2025. We expect these factors will result in a 2026 year-over-year\nexpense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth rate.\nTurning now to the capex outlook. We currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including\nprincipal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion, narrowed from our prior\noutlook of $64-72 billion and up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the mid-point. While\nthe infrastructure planning process remains highly dynamic, we currently expect another year of\nsimilarly significant capex dollar growth in 2026 as we continue aggressively pursuing9\nopportunities to bring additional capacity online to ", "meet the needs of our AI efforts and business\noperations.\nOn to tax. With the enactment of the new U.S. tax law, we anticipate a reduction in our U.S. federal\ncash tax for the remainder of the current year and future years. There are several alternative ways\nof implementing the provisions of the Act, which we are currently evaluating. While we estimate\nthat the 2025 tax rate will be higher than our Q2 tax rate, we cannot quantify the magnitude at\nthis time.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal\nand regulatory headwinds in the EU that could significantly impact our business and our financial\nresults. For example, we continue to engage with the European Commission on our Less\nPersonalized Ads offering, or LPA, which we introduced in November 2024 based on feedback\nfrom the European Commission in connection with the DMA. As the Commission provides further\nfeedback on LPA, we cannot rule out that it may seek to impose further modifications to it that\nwould result in a materially worse user and advertiser experience. This could have a significant\nnegative impact on our European revenue, as early as later this quarter. We have ", "appealed the\nEuropean Commission’s DMA decision but any modifications to our model may be imposed during\nthe appeal process.\nIn closing, this was another strong quarter for our business as our investments in infrastructure\nand technical talent continue to improve core ads performance and engagement on our platforms.\nWe expect the significant investments we’re making now will allow us to continue leveraging\nadvances in AI to extend those gains and unlock a new set of opportunities in the years to come.\nWith that, Krista, let’s open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now open the lines for a question and answer session. To\nask a question, please press star one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw\nyour question, again press star one.\nPlease limit yourself to one question. Please pick up your handset before\nasking your question to ensure clarity. If you are streaming today’s call, please\nmute your computer speakers. And your first question comes from the line of\nEric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Mark, when you think about where\nthe AI parts of your business have been evolving over the last thr", "ee to six\nmonths, I wanted to know what your key learnings were as you went deep into\nthat strategy that inform some of the shifts in both talent, acquisition and\ncompute.\nCoupled with some of the blogs you put out recently in terms of how that\nstrategy might have evolved based on those key learnings. And Susan, building\non Mark’s comments on scaling talent and compute, I wanted to know if you\ncould go a little bit deeper in how we should be thinking about those two\ncomponents driving some of the commentary you’ve given around OpEx and\nCapEx over the next 12 to 18 months. Thanks so much.10\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. Sure. I can start. At a high level, I think that there are all these questions\nthat people have about what are going to be the timelines to get to really\nstrong AI or Superintelligence or whatever you want to call it.\nAnd I guess at each step along the way so far, we’ve observed the more kind of\naggressive assumptions or the fastest assumptions have been the ones that\nhave most accurately predicted what would happen. And I think that, that just\ncontinued to happen over the course of this year, too.\nAnd -- so I’ve given a number of those anecdotes on these earnings calls in t", "he\npast. And I think, certainly, some of the work that we’re seeing with teams\ninternally being able to adapt Llama 4 to build autonomous AI agents that can\nhelp improve the Facebook algorithm to increase quality and engagement, or\nlike.\nI mean that’s like a fairly profound thing if you think about it. I mean it’s\nhappening in low volume right now. So I’m not sure that, that result by itself\nwas a major contributor to this quarter’s earnings or anything like that.\nBut I think the trajectory on this stuff is very optimistic. And I think it’s one of\nthe interesting challenges in running a business like this now is there’s just a\nvery high chance, it seems, like the world is going to look pretty different in a\nfew years from now. And on the one hand, there are all these things that we can\ndo, there are improvements to our core products that exist.\nAnd then I think we have this principle that we believe in across the company,\nwhich we tell people, take Superintelligence seriously. And the basic principle is\nthis idea that we think that this is going to really shape all of our systems\nsooner rather than later, not necessarily on the trajectory of a quarter or two,\nbut on the trajectory ", "of a few years.\nAnd I think that, that’s just going to change a lot of the assumptions around\nhow different things work across the company. So anyway, I think it’s basically\njust we’re continually observing how this works and what the trajectory or the\npace of AI progress has been.\nI think it continues to be on the faster end. And that I think informs a lot of the\ndecisions from everything from the importance and value of having the\nabsolute best and most elite talent dense team at the company to making sure\nthat we have a leading compute fleet so that the people here can do – so that\nthe researchers here have more compute per person to be able to leave their\nresearch and then roll it out to billions of people across our products, making\nsure that we build and drive these products through all the different things that\nwe do.\nWhich I think is one of the things that our company is the best in the world at is\nbasically when we take a technology, we’re good at driving that through all of\nour apps and our ad systems and all that stuff, it’s not just going to kind of sit\non the vine.11\nI think that there’s no other company, I think that is as good as us at kind of\ntaking something and ki", "nd of getting it in front of billions of people. So yes, I\nmean we’re just going to push very aggressively on all of that.\nBut at some level, yes, this is -- there’s sort of a bet and a trajectory that we’re\nseeing and those are the signals that we’re seeing. But we’re just trying to read\nit.\nSusan Li: Eric, for the second part of your question, we haven’t, in fact, kicked off our\nbudgeting process for 2026. So thinking about next year, there are clearly\nmany, many moving pieces in a very dynamic operating environment.\nBut there are certain aspects that we have some visibility into today including\nthe rough shape of our 2026 infrastructure plans. And that flows through into\nour expense expectations next year. And we also have some visibility into the\ncompensation expense growth that we’ll recognize from the AI talent that\nwe’re hiring this year.\nAnd so those two things are part of why we gave a little bit of an early preview\ninto the expectations for growth for 2026 total expenses as well as for 2026\nCapEx.\nSo on the total expenses side, as I mentioned, we expect infrastructure will be\nthe single largest contributor to 2026 expense growth. That’s driven primarily\nby a sharp acceler", "ation in depreciation expense growth in 2026, largely driven\nby recognizing incremental depreciation from assets that we purchased and\nplaced in service in ‘26 as well as from infrastructure deployed through 2025\nthat we’ll recognize a full year of depreciation next year.\nWe also expect a greater mix of our CapEx to be in shorter-lived assets in 2025\nand ‘26 than it has been in prior years. And then the other component of infra\ncost growth next year would come from higher operating expenses including\nenergy costs, leases, maintenance and operational expenses that are\nassociated with maintaining that fleet.\nAnd we also expect some increased spend on cloud services in ‘26 to meet our\ncapacity needs as well as growth in network-related costs.\nSo a lot going on, on the infrastructure side as it contributes to the 2026 total\nexpense number. After that, employee compensation is the next largest driver\nof expense growth in ’26, again, driven primarily in the investments that we’re\nmaking in technical talent including recognizing a full year of compensation\nexpense for the AI talent we hire this year.\nI realize this answer is getting a little long, so I’ll try to wrap up quickly. On the\nCa", "pEx side, the big driver of our increased CapEx in ‘26 will be scaling GenAI\ncapacity as we build out training capacity that’s going to drive higher spend\nacross servers, networking, data centers next year.12\nWe also expect that we’re going to continue investing significantly in core AI in\n2026. And again, this is a pretty very dynamic area of planning, but we wanted\nto share kind of our early thoughts as things are shaping up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nPlease go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Mark, just to kind of\ngo back to the intelligence labs and sort of the vision for Superintelligence.\nAs you sort of sit here now versus 12 months ago, can you just sort of walk us\nthrough any changes of technological constraints or technological gating\nfactors that you are most focused on overcoming in the next 24 months that\nmay have been different than they were in the past just to make sure you can\nreally lead in the idea of Superintelligence over the next ten years?\nAnd then the second one to Susan or Mark, one on the core, you’ve made so\nmany improvements to the core to drive higher", " engagement,\nrecommendations, et cetera.\nCan you just walk us through a couple of the factors you’re still most excited\nabout to come in the next 18 months that you think could drive a further lift to\nengagement on the core platform? Thanks.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. Sure. I mean in terms of the research agenda and a bunch of the areas that\nwe’re very focused on.\nI do think focusing on self-improvement is a very important area of research.\nAnd there’s obviously different scaling paradigms, and I don’t want to get too\nmuch into the detail of research that we’re doing on this.\nBut I think that for developing superintelligence at some level, you’re not just\ngoing to be learning from people because you’re trying to build something that\nis fundamentally smarter than people.\nSo it’s going to need to learn how to -- or you’re going to need to develop a way\nfor it to be able to improve itself.\nSo that, I think, is a very fundamental thing. That is going to have very broad\nimplications for how we build products, how we run the company, new things\nthat we can invent, new discoveries that can be made, society more broadly.\nI think that, that’s just a very fundamental part of this. In terms of the", " shape of\nthe effort overall, I guess I’ve just gotten a little bit more convinced around the\nability for small talent-dense teams to be the optimal configuration for driving\nfrontier research. And it’s a bit of a different setup than we have on our other\nworld-class machine learning systems.\nSo if you look at like what we do in Instagram or Facebook or our ad system, we\ncan very productively have many hundreds or thousands of people basically13\nworking on improving those systems, and we have very well-developed\nsystems for kind of individuals to run tests and be able to test a bunch of\ndifferent things. You don’t need every researcher there to have the whole\nsystem in their head.\nBut I think for this -- for the leading research on superintelligence, you really\nwant the smallest group that can hold the whole thing in their head, which\ndrives, I think, some of the physics around the team size and how -- and the\ndynamics around how that works. But I’ll hand it over to Susan to talk about\nmore of the practical stuff.\nSusan Li: Brian, on the sort of forward-looking roadmap for the core recommendation\nengine. There are a handful of shorter-term things that we’re focused on in the\nnear t", "erm.\nOne is we’re focused on making recommendations even more adaptive to what\na person is engaging with during their session so that the recommendations we\nsurface are the most relevant to what they’re interested in at that moment.\nAnd we’re making optimizations to help the best content from smaller creators\nbreak out by matching it to the right audiences sooner after it gets posted. And\nwe’re also working on improving the ability for our systems to discover more\ndiversified and niche interests for each person through interest exploration and\nlearning explicit user preferences.\nWe’re also planning to scale up our models further and incorporate more\nadvanced techniques that should improve the overall quality of\nrecommendations. But we also have a lot of long-term bets in the hopper\naround areas like developing foundational models that will support\nrecommendations across multiple services, incorporating LLMs more deeply\ninto our recommendation systems.\nAnd a big focus of this work is going to be on optimizing the systems to make\nthem more efficient, so that we can continue to scale up the capacity that we\nuse for our recommendation systems without eroding the ROI that we deliver.\nOp", "erator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nPlease go ahead.\nDouglas Anmuth: Thanks so much for taking the questions. One for Mark and one for Susan.\nMark, Meta has been a huge proponent of open source AI. How has your\nthinking changed here at all, just as you pursue superintelligence and push for\neven greater returns on your significant infrastructure investments? And then,\nSusan, your comments on ‘26 CapEx suggest more than $100 billion of spend\nnext year potentially. Do you continue to expect to finance all this yourself? Or\ncould there be opportunities to partner here? Thanks.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I mean on open source, I don’t think that our thinking has particularly\nchanged on this. We’ve always open-sourced some of our models and not open\nsourced everything that we’ve done.14\nSo I would expect that we will continue to produce and share leading open\nsource models. I also think that there are a couple of trends that are playing\nout.\nOne is that we’re getting models that are so big that they’re just not practical\nfor a lot of other people to use. So it’s -- we would kind of wrestle with whether\nit’s productive or helpful to share that or if tha", "t’s really just primarily helping\ncompetitors or something like that.\nSo I think that there’s that concern. And then obviously as you approach real\nsuperintelligence, I think there is a whole different set of safety concerns that I\nthink we need to take very seriously that I wrote about in my note this morning.\nBut I think the bottom line is, I would expect that we will continue open\nsourcing work.\nI expect us to continue to be a leader there. And I also expect us to continue to\nnot open source everything that we do, which is a continuation of kind of what\nwe’ve been kind of working on. And yes, I mean I think Susan will talk a little bit\nmore about the infrastructure, but it really is a massive investment.\nWe think it will be good over time. But we do take very seriously that this is a\njust massive amount of capital to convert into many gigawatts of compute\nwhich we think is going to help us produce leading research and quality\nproducts and running the business, I do look for opportunities to basically\nconvert capital into quality of products that we can deliver for people.\nBut this is certainly a massive bet that we’re kind of -- we’re focused on and we\nwant to make sure that wha", "t we build -- accrues to building the best products\nthat we can deliver to the billions of people who use our services.\nSusan Li: Doug, on your second question about how we expect to finance the growing\nCapEx next year. We certainly expect that we will finance some large share of\nthat ourselves, but we’re also exploring ways to work with financial partners to\ncodevelop data centers.\nWe don’t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe\nthat there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to\nsupport large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to\nbuild world-class infrastructure while providing us with flexibility should our\ninfrastructure requirements change over time. So we are exploring many\ndifferent paths.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nPlease go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. I’ll ask another one on the infrastructure. Mark, your spend is\nnow approaching some of the biggest hyperscalers out there. Do you think of\nall this capacity mostly for internal uses? Or do you think there’s a way to share15\nor even come up with a business model where ", "leveraging that capacity for\nexternal uses?\nAnd then Susan, when you think about the ROI on this CapEx, I’m sure you\nhave internal models, I’m sure you can’t share all that, but how are you thinking\nabout the ROI? And are you optimistic about the long-term returns? Thank you.\nSusan Li: Justin, I can go ahead and take a crack at both of those. And obviously Mark,\nyou should feel free to weigh in. Right now we are focused on ensuring that we\nhave enough capacity for our internal use cases, which includes both all of the\ncore AI work that we do to support the recommendation engine work on the\norganic content side, to support all the ads ranking and recommendation work.\nAnd then, of course, to make sure that we are building the training capacity\nthat we think we need in order to build frontier AI models. And to make sure\nthat we’re preparing ourselves for the types of inference use cases that we\nthink might -- that we might have ahead of us as we eventually focus not only\non developing frontier models, but also how we can expand into the kinds of\nconsumer use cases that we think will be hopefully widely useful and engaging\nfor our users.\nSo at present, we’re not really thinking about e", "xternal use cases on the\ninfrastructure, but I’d say it’s a good question. On your second question, which\nis really around the sort of ROI on CapEx, there are a couple of things.\nSo again, on the core AI side, we continue to see strong ROI. Our ability to\nmeasure that is quite good, and we feel sort of very good about the rigorous\nmeasurement and returns that we see there.\nOn the GenAI side, we are clearly much, much earlier on the return curve and\nwe don’t expect that the GenAI work is going to be a meaningful driver of\nrevenue this year or next year.\nBut we remain generally very optimistic about the monetization opportunities\nthat will open up, and Mark spoke to them in his script, the sort of five pillars, so\nI won’t repeat them here.\nAnd we think that over the medium- to long-term timeframe, those are\nopportunities that are very adjacent and intuitive for where -- in terms of where\nour business is today, why they would be big opportunities for us and that\nthere will be sort of big markets attached to each of them.\nSo we, again, are also -- I would say, the last thing I would add here is we are\nbuilding the infrastructure with fungibility in mind. Obviously there are a lot of\nth", "ings that you have to build up front in terms of the data center shells, the\nnetworking infrastructure, et cetera.\nBut we will be ordering servers, which ultimately will be the biggest bulk of\nCapEx spend as we need them and when we need them and making sort of the16\nbest decisions at those times in terms of figuring out where the capacity will go\nto use.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Please\ngo ahead.\nMark Shmulik: Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Mark, as you go after the\nSuperintelligence vision, especially for those of us on the outside, what are kind\nof some of the markers or KPIs that you’re tracking on whether you’re on track\nand making progress? Is it really against kind of those five pillars you outlined\nabove? Or should we be thinking more broadly?\nAnd Susan, obviously AI is delivering great ROI today, all those investments\nand also building towards kind of longer-term goals. Just curious, has there just\nbeen any change or adjustment to how you think about the relationship\nbetween revenues or core business performance and the cadence of\ninvestments? Thank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. In terms of what to look at, I mea", "n what I’m going to look at internally, the\nquality of the people on the teams, the quality of the models that we’re\nproducing, the rate of improvement of our other AI systems across the\ncompany and the extent to which the leading kind of foundation models that\nwe’re building contribute to improving all of the other AI systems and kind of\neverything that we’re doing around the company.\nThen I think you just get into our standard product and business playbook,\nwhich is translating that technology into new products, which will first scale to\nbillions of people and then over time we will monetize.\nBut I think that there’s going to be some lag in that, right? And that, I think, is\nkind of always the way that we work is, whether we’re building some new social\nproduct or this something like Meta AI or a new product around this that we’re\ngoing to work on getting to leading scale, building the highest quality product,\nfocused on that for a few years. And then once we’re really confident in that\nposition, then we’ll focus on ramping up the business around it.\nSo it’s -- I mean going back to the last question a little bit, it’s sort of when you\ncompare this business to some of the cloud bus", "inesses, it’s like we do have this\ndelay where we focus on building research and then doing research and then\nramping consumer products, and it often does take some period of time before\nwe really are ramping up the business around it.\nI think that’s kind of a known property of our business and the cycle around it.\nBut I guess, on the flip side, we believe that if you are building\nsuperintelligence, you should use all of your GPUs to make it so that you’re\nserving your customers really well with that.\nAnd we think that there’s going to be a much higher return than we can do by\ngenerating that directly rather than just kind of renting or leasing out the\ninfrastructure at other companies.17\nSusan Li: On the second part of your question, we’ve said in the past that our primary\nfocus from a profitability perspective is driving consolidated operating profit\ngrowth over time. And it won’t be linear.\nIn some years, we’ll deliver above-average profit growth. And in years where\nwe’re making big investments, I think we will see that impact the amount of\noperating profit growth that we can deliver. And at the moment, we see a lot of\nattractive investment opportunities that we believe are goin", "g to set us up to\ndeliver compelling profit growth in the coming years for all of our investors.\nAnd so we’re focused on constraining investments elsewhere as we pursue\nthose investments. But we really believe that this is a time for us to really make\ninvestments in the future of AI as I think it will open up both new opportunities\nfor us in addition to strengthen our core business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go\nahead.\nRonald Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to ask you on Meta AI and\nI think you talked about in the call just growing engagement overall, particularly\non WhatsApp and now you have 1 billion users on the platform and the focus is\nnow on driving personalization.\nSo I want to understand a little bit more how these next-gen models can help\ndrive adoption here, particularly with Behemoth coming online at some point.\nAnd then as people are using Meta AI with WhatsApp, thoughts on search and\nqueries and potentially monetizing that.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I’m not going to get super deep into the roadmap on this, but the basic --\nwe do see that as we continue improving the models behind Meta AI and ", "post\ntraining and just engagement increases and as we swap in the updated models,\nwhen we go from Llama 4 to Llama 4.1 when we have that, we expect that just\n-- the models are inherently pretty general.\nSo it’s -- yes, you focus on specific areas, but in general, just sort of gets better\nat a lot of different things that people want to ask it or want to do with it. And I\nthink with each version, both like what we’re doing on a week-to-week basis in\nterms of continuing to train it. And when we drop kind of new generations or\nbig dot releases of each generation, that will improve engagement, too.\nSo we’re focused on that. I’m not going to go into the specific research areas or\ncapabilities that we’re planning on dropping in the future. But obviously I’m\npretty excited about it.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.\nPlease go ahead.\nYoussef Squali: Great, thank you guys for taking the questions. I have two. So Mark, the Ray-\nBan initiative has been a homerun for you guys so far. Where are we on the18\ndevelopment of glasses? Is that new computational platform that you’ve talked\nabout in the past? Is it moving faster or slower than you", " thought? And as you\nleverage Meta AI, do you believe glasses will ultimately replace smartphones?\nOr do you need a new form factor that’s AI first? And then, Susan, just quickly,\nhow do you guys see SBC progressing over the next couple of years? Is it fair to\nassume it will grow materially faster than revenue and OpEx? And how do you\nminimize shareholder dilution? Thank you.\nMark Zuckerberg: Yes. I can talk a bit about the glasses. Yes. I mean I’m very excited about the\nprogress that we’re making. I think both the Ray-Ban Metas and I’m very\nexcited about the Oakley Meta, the HSTN’s too and other things that we have\nplanned.\nYes. I mean this product category is clearly doing quite well. And I think it’s\ngood for a lot of things. It is stylish eyewear, so people like wearing them just as\nglasses.\nIt has a bunch of interesting functionality. And then the use of Meta AI in them\njust continues to grow, and the percent of people who are using it for that on a\ndaily basis is increasing, and that’s all good to see.\nI mean I continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form\nfactor for AI because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day,\nhear what you hear", ", talk to you. Once you get a display in there, whether it’s the\nkind of wide holographic field of view like we showed with Orion or just a\nsmaller display that might be good for displaying some information.\nAnd that’s also going to unlock a lot of value where you can just interact with\nan AI assistant throughout the day in this multimodal way. It can see the\ncontent around you. It can generate a UI for you, show you information and be\nhelpful.\nI mean I personally think that -- I wear contact lenses, I feel like if I didn’t have\nmy vision corrected, I’d be sort of at a cognitive disadvantage going through\nthe world. And I think in the future, if you don’t have glasses that have AI or\nsome way to interact with AI, I think you’re kind of similarly probably be at a\npretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people who you’re\nworking with, or competing against.\nSo I think that this is a pretty fundamental form factor. There are a lot of\ndifferent versions of it. Right now we’re building ones that I think are stylish,\nbut aren’t focused on the display.\nI think that there’s a whole set of different things to explore with displays. This\nis kind of what we’ve been maxing o", "ut with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10\nyears is basically doing the research on all of these different things.19\nAnd it’s a -- I don’t know 10 years ago, I would have -- like the other thing that’s\nawesome about glasses is, they are going to be the ideal way to blend the\nphysical and digital worlds together.\nSo the whole metaverse vision, I think, is going to end up being extremely\nimportant, too, and AI is going to accelerate that, too.\nIt’s just that if you’d asked me five years ago, whether we’d have kind of\nholograms that created immersive experiences or superintelligence first, I think\nmost people would have thought that you’d get the holograms first. And it’s\nthis interesting kind of quirk of the tech industry that I think we’re going to end\nup having really strong AI first.\nBut because we’ve been investing in this, I think we’re just several years ahead\non building out glasses. And I think that, that’s something that we’re excited to\nkeep on investing in heavily because I think it’s going to be a really important\npart of the future.\nKenneth Dorell: Youssef, we didn’t quite catch your second question, do you mind just\nrepeating it?\nYoussef Squali: Sure. Just as you look a", "t the spend on stock-based compensation over the next\ncouple of years with all these hires, I’m assuming that we’re going to see that\nmaterially or grow materially faster maybe than revenue and OpEx. And I just\nwant to know how -- what you guys are doing to plan to minimize shareholder\ndilution? Is it mostly buybacks or anything else? Thank you.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Youssef. So I mean the impact of the sort of increased compensation\ncosts including SBC, of our AI hires this year is reflected in the revised 2025\nexpense outlook and in the comments I made about sort of the 2026, expense\noutlook.\nThose are obviously a big driver of 2026 expense growth as we recognize the\nfull year of compensation for the additional talent we’re bringing on. Having\nsaid that, so we factored that into our sort of expense outlook. Having said\nthat, we certainly -- we are very focused on making sure, on keeping an eye on\ndilution.\nAnd we generally believe that our strong financial position is going to allow us\nto support these investments while continuing to repurchase shares as part of\nthe sort of buyback program that offsets equity compensation and as well as\nprovide quarterly cash dividend distributions t", "o our investors.\nKenneth Dorell: Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking\nwith you again soon.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation, and\nyou may now disconnect."]}
